## Accessing Demo

Demo app can be seen at [https://bluesmpp.com:8443](https://bluesmpp.com:8443). You can use username **demo** and password **demo123** to login and test.

## Demo Limitations

Sms sending in demo is simulated in demo and in real usage, we would use actual operator SMPP credentials to send messages. Adding/Editing users is restricted and modifying connection configuration is also forbidden.

## Grafana stats

Grafana stats can be seen by clicking SMS stats on demo interface's side navigation. You can login into Grafana using **demo** and **demo123**. After logging in, select time range to be last 5 minutes in top right of Grafana UI  to see latest state. We intend to improvie stats integration in future.
